    "The variables of interest are characteristics of the residences that are owned within and around QOZs. This will be particularly helpful in surmising the state of homeownership within areas with high concentrations of QOZs. I hope to gain insight on whether areas with a significant amount of mortgages more or less likely to be located within the tax incentivized areas. I would also like to see whether new-builds or older homes are more likely to be surrounding QOZs. The answers to these two questions could give valuable evidence to see if QOZs are implemented as intended or are being monopolized by entities outside of the communities they fall within. \n",

    "Across all three spatial analyses (Global Moran’s I, Getis-Ord Gi, and Local Moran’s I), the results show a clear and uneven geography of mortgage ownership in California. Mortgage-holding households cluster strongly in suburban, higher-income areas, while urban cores and historically disinvested neighborhoods form equally distinct clusters of low mortgage ownership. These low-ownership clusters align closely with many Qualified Opportunity Zones. This suggests that QOZs are overwhelmingly located in areas where mortgage access, wealth-building, and long-term residential stability have been limited for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hotspot analysis reinforces this pattern. High mortgage hot spots occur in stable, investment-heavy suburban markets that fall outside QOZ boundaries. Mortgage cold spots appear in renter-dominated and lower-income areas, which often map directly onto QOZ-designated tracts. The Local Moran’s I results add nuance by showing not only low-ownership clusters but also outliers. Many QOZs sit within Low–Low clusters where weak homeownership is widespread, indicating long-term structural barriers. But some appear as Low–High outliers, where neighborhoods with very low mortgage ownership sit next to strong ownership markets. These edge conditions often represent early stages of market pressure and are associated with redevelopment, speculation, and shifting property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these spatial patterns raise important questions about the intended versus actual impacts of QOZs. While the program does target economically vulnerable neighborhoods, the location of QOZs within low ownership areas and adjacent to high-value suburban markets suggests a greater risk of fueling gentrification rather than supporting community-rooted economic stability. Instead of reinforcing local wealth-building, QOZ incentives may make these neighborhoods more attractive to outside investors, accelerating turnover and displacement pressures. In short, the spatial evidence points to QOZs functioning less as tools for stabilizing distressed communities and more as mechanisms that may amplify existing inequalities and encourage investment forward transformation."
