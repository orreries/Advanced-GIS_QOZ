It is pertinent to see if current homeowners also benefit from being within tax incentivized areas or if they may contribute to an environment where homeowners' properities are being poached by outside enitities through the guise of economic development.

    "The variables of interest are characteristics of the residences that are owned within and around QOZs. This will be particularly helpful in surmising the state of homeownership within areas with high concentrations of QOZs. I hope to gain insight on whether areas with a significant amount of mortgages more or less likely to be located within the tax incentivized areas. I would also like to see whether new-builds or older homes are more likely to be surrounding QOZs. The answers to these two questions could give valuable evidence to see if QOZs are implemented as intended or are being monopolized by entities outside of the communities they fall within. \n",

    "The deep red areas that are largely in suburban zones such as the Inland Empire, Santa Clarita, Simi Valley, and much of Contra Costa and Alameda Counties indicate high concentrations of mortgage-holding households clustered together. These regions reflect places with strong homeownership markets, newer housing stock, and historically higher rates of mortgage uptake. The blue areas indicate cold spots, signaling neighborhoods with significantly lower levels of mortgaged homeownership. Cold spots appear notably central Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, and parts of San Francisco. \n",

This spatial contrast makes visible the uneven geography of homeownership and further underscores where investment and potential displacement pressures may concentrate over time.\n"

    "Across all three spatial analyses (Global Moran’s I, Getis-Ord Gi, and Local Moran’s I), the results show a clear and uneven geography of mortgage ownership in California. Mortgage holding households cluster strongly in suburban, higher income areas, while urban cores and historically disinvested neighborhoods form equally distinct clusters of low mortgage ownership. These low-ownership clusters align closely with many Qualified Opportunity Zones. This suggests that QOZs are overwhelmingly located in areas where mortgage access, wealth building, and long term residential stability have been limited for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hotspot analysis reinforces this pattern. High mortgage hot spots occur in stable, investment-heavy suburban markets that fall outside QOZ boundaries. Mortgage cold spots appear in renter dominated and lower income areas, which often map directly onto QOZ-designated tracts. The Local Moran’s I results add nuance by showing not only low ownership clusters but also outliers. Many QOZs sit within Low–Low clusters where weak homeownership is widespread, indicating long term structural barriers. But some appear as Low–High outliers, where neighborhoods with very low mortgage ownership sit next to strong ownership markets. These edge conditions often represent early stages of market pressure and are associated with redevelopment, speculation, and shifting property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these spatial patterns raise important questions about the intended versus actual impacts of QOZs. While the program does target economically vulnerable neighborhoods, the location of QOZs within low ownership areas and adjacent to high-value suburban markets suggests a greater risk of fueling gentrification rather than supporting community based stability. Instead of reinforcing local economic stability, QOZ incentives may make these neighborhoods more attractive to outside investors, accelerating turnover and displacement pressures. In short, the spatial evidence points to QOZs functioning less as tools for stabilizing distressed communities and more as mechanisms that may amplify existing inequalities and encourage investment forward transformation."
