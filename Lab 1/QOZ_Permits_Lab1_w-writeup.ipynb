    "This spatial analysis reveals critical insights for community development, investment strategy, and policy evaluation at the intersection of Qualified Opportunity Zones and construction activity. High-permit counties show notable overlap with QOZ-adjacent areas, suggesting that federal tax incentives are successfully catalyzing development in economically distressed communities. This pattern is seen within Southern California and Florida's urban areas. However, this pattern raises important questions about equitable growth and the risk of gentrification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For investors, target regions where green outlines overlap with the deepest purple shading to maximize QOZ tax benefits and access markets demonstrating construction activity. Policymakers should assess if development leads to affordable housing and community amenities. Without proper intention toward the residents within these areas, it may invite projects that accelerate community displacement.\n",
    "Communities in QOZ areas with high permit acquisition rates face both opportunities and risks. New investment can bring jobs, infrastructure, and services. However, without intentional planning and community benefit agreements, these forces may also give rise to displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the IRS QOZ frequently asked questions, investors do not need to be part of the community before taking advantage of these tax incentives. If looking to support distressed economies, the focus should be on housing affordability, demographic shifts, and local hiring outcomes in these zones before implementing tax incentives. This will help assess whether QOZ incentives achieve their intended purpose of inclusive economic revitalization.\n"
